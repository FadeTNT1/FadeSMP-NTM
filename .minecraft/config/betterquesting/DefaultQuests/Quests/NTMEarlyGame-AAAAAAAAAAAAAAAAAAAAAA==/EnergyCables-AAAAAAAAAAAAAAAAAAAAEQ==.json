      "desc:8": "The most basic block for transmission is the red copper cable, which comes in two varieties, a block form and a skinnier cable form. The block form also has a paintable version which can help it blend into your designs better.\nFor better looking, aswell as longer distance energy transportation, a Cable Drum with Electricity Connectors can be used. These powerlines are non solid and can also pass through floors and walls.\n\nCapacitors are similar to energy storage blocks in that they can store power, but they also act as diodes, only allowing power to flow in one direction through them, while holding onto any excess power that doesn\u0027t flow into any energy storage blocks or machines.\n\n",
